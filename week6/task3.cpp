TASK 3 – Calculate the price for a customer’s order
Extend TASK 2 to calculate a price for an order. Prices for the sacks are as follows:
regular price for each sack
cement, $3
gravel, $2
sand, $2
discount price for a special pack containing 1 sack of cement, 2 sacks of sand and 2 sacks of gravel,
$10
Calculate and output the regular price for the order. Check how many special packs are in the order. If
a discount price applies then output the new price for the order and the amount saved.
